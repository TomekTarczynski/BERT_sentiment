# Business Requirements for Machine Learning Project Using BERT

## Project Title
**Sentiment Analysis for E-Commerce Product Reviews**

---

## Objective
Develop a sentiment analysis model using a pre-trained BERT model to classify product reviews as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**. The goal is to enable businesses to understand customer feedback and improve product quality and customer satisfaction.

---

## Business Requirements

### Core Functionalities
- Build a text classification model capable of identifying sentiment in product reviews.
- Support three sentiment categories: **Positive**, **Neutral**, and **Negative**.
- Provide a clear accuracy threshold of at least 85% on a test set for real-world applicability.

### Input and Output
- **Input**: Raw text reviews (e.g., "The product quality is amazing!").
- **Output**: Sentiment class (`Positive`, `Neutral`, or `Negative`).

### Data Handling
- The dataset should include balanced classes to ensure reliable performance across all sentiment types.
- Preprocess text to clean noise, normalize text (e.g., lowercasing, removing HTML tags), and tokenize efficiently for BERT.

### Scalability
- Design the pipeline to handle up to 10,000 reviews at once.
- Ensure predictions for new data are made within a latency of 200 ms per review on the GPU.

### Explainability
- Provide visualizations or metrics for feature importance (e.g., attention scores) to explain which parts of the text contributed most to the sentiment classification.

### Infrastructure
- Utilize a GPU with **6GB of memory**, ensuring the model fits into memory constraints by:
  - Using a **smaller BERT variant** such as **DistilBERT** or **TinyBERT**.
  - Limiting the maximum sequence length to 128 tokens to reduce memory usage.
  - Implementing batch processing to optimize GPU utilization.
- Optimize the training process to ensure completion within **4 hours**.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Use the **F1-score** to evaluate the model's performance to balance precision and recall.
- Report accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### Model Deployment
- Package the model into a lightweight, production-ready service (e.g., FastAPI or Flask).
- Create an endpoint for batch prediction of review sentiments.

## Dataset Recommendation

### Dataset: [Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023)
- **Description**: This dataset contains millions of product reviews from Amazon customers with metadata, including review text and star ratings.
- **Relevance**: Star ratings can be mapped to sentiment labels (e.g., 1-2 stars = Negative, 3 stars = Neutral, 4-5 stars = Positive).
- **Access**: Free and publicly available through AWS.

---

## Key Constraints
- **Memory**: Use a smaller BERT model (e.g., DistilBERT or TinyBERT) to meet GPU memory constraints.
- **Time**: Ensure training completes within a reasonable time frame (4 hours on a 6GB GPU).
- **Efficiency**: Optimize data preprocessing, tokenization, and batching for GPU usage.

## Future Enhancements
- Extend the model to support multi-language sentiment analysis.
- Integrate with e-commerce platforms for real-time sentiment tracking and reporting.
